# Custom Machine Learning Library in Assembly (Neural NET ASM)

This project aims to create a custom machine learning library implemented in Assembly language. The library focuses on neural networks and kernel functions, providing a high-performance and flexible solution for various machine learning tasks.

## Features

### Neural Network Implementation:
- Supports various neural network architectures (e.g., feedforward, convolutional, recurrent)
- Implements different activation functions:
  - Sigmoid
  - ReLU
  - Leaky ReLU
  - Tanh
- Provides optimization algorithms:
  - Gradient Descent
  - Adam

### Kernel Functions:
- Includes commonly used kernel functions:
  - Linear
  - Polynomial
  - RBF (Radial Basis Function)
- Supports custom kernel functions

### Data Handling:
- Efficient data loading and preprocessing
- Handles numerical data and categorical features

### Performance Optimization:
- Leverages Assembly language for performance-critical operations
- Optimizes memory access patterns and instruction scheduling

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdityaSrivastavDS/Neural-NET-ASM
   ```
2. Install dependencies: Make sure to install the necessary assembly tools (e.g., NASM, LD):
```bash
# Example for NASM and LD installation (adjust for your platform)
sudo apt-get install nasm
sudo apt-get install binutils
```

## Usage
1. Prepare data:
- Create training and testing data files in the specified format (e.g., CSV, TXT).

2. Train the model:
- Use the library's functions to create a neural network, load data, and train the model.

3. Make predictions:
- Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
- 
Example
Here is a simple code snippet:

```bash
; Example Assembly Code
; Load data
; Create neural network
; Train the model
; Make predictions
```
